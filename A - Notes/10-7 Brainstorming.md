## Sylica
#Sylica is a dark opal radiating prismatic light. 

Core forms:
* Raw ore -> unstable, mutagenic
* Refined -> black opals with prismatic light emanating

Uses:
* Essentially a magic battery
* Different technologies can activate Sylica in different ways. For example, there is a module that has been created that allows airships to heat and compress air to granularly control speed and height. There are other technologies that rapidly deplete the magic from the opals that causes explosions.

## Places

### Tasis
[[Tasis]] is the continent where the majority of the story takes place. It's loosely governed by a oligarchy with representation from each of the major factions. That oligarchy is called [[The Council]]. The Council has an elected official called [[The Praetor]] who's job is to be a symbolic leader who oversees council meetings. However the key word there is "symbolic" and The Praetor doesn't have any real power. 

### Caelm

[[Caelm]] is the capital city of Tasis. All factions are represented here but the prominent faction is [[The Consortium]]. Caelm is the most multicultural of all of the major cities but is primarily the home of [[Humans]]. 

### Derwynne
[[Derwynne]] is one of the four major cities in Tasis. It's located high in the canopy of the Derwynne Forest. Buildings are built into the trees and connected by a network of hanging bridges. Whereas Caelm's infrastructure is largely driven by technology-powered Sylica, Derwynne is more ecological. They have managed to infuse the forest with Sylica and they're society is more ecotech than pure magitech. Because of the inaccessible nature of the city, Derwynne is almost exclusively inhabited by [[Elves]]. It's governed and represented by the [[Enclave of Derwynne]] faction

### Clairen
[[Clairen]] is another of the major cities in Tasis and is the home of the [[Fairies]]. 

### Stenvarg
[[Stenvarg]] is the last of the major cities in Tasis and is the home of the [[Dwarves]]
